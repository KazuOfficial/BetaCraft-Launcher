<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
##### History Of The Project

Back in 2018 Betacraft, a Minecraft server running on version b1.7.3 was about to be transformated into a modded Minecraft server. Me and Moresteck, the adminsitrators of Betacraft, knew that people won't be willing to install mods on their own, therefore we acknowledged the fact that there will be less people playing on our server. We wanted to prevent that, so the idea of Betacraft Launcher was born.

The first public version of the launcher was able to download and run a premade modded Minecraft version prepared specifally for our server. The idea of a simple launcher made specifally for a small Minecraft server grew into a mission of providing the best nostalgic Minecraft experience out there.

Now Betacraft consists of:
* A Polish Minecraft server running on version b1.7.3 (ip: betacraft.pl).
* Betacraft Launcher, which with the help of Betacraft Proxy introduces various fixes and addons for older Minecraft versions.
* Betacraft Proxy, which brings back support for skins, sounds, and textures on older Minecraft versions.
* Betacraft Website, which allows you to change your skin and cape in Betacraft Proxy, and which is a home for all Betacraft products.
